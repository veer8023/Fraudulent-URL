# Fraudulent-URL

This project aims to identify and classify potentially fraudulent URLs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns and characteristics commonly associated with phishing, malware, and other malicious websites, the model can differentiate between legitimate and harmful URLs. This detection system helps improve cybersecurity by flagging suspicious URLs before they cause harm.

Key features include:

Dataset: Collection of URLs labeled as legitimate or fraudulent.
Feature Extraction: Analysis of URL structure, domain info, and web content for feature generation.
Modeling: Use of machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks) to predict the legitimacy of URLs.
Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's effectiveness.



This project can be integrated into security systems or web applications to provide an extra layer of protection against online fraud and attacks.
